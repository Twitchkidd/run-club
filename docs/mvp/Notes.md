# Notes!

It'd be nice if after you Friend-Requested someone on the Runners List, they faded out after a second and the list shunted up. Also, how about swipe left to not show, whether you code it in or not, people are going to try to do it.

One thing to do to refine the design would be to make the views into a flow chart like thing.

(While working in Figma:) Oh, okay, I never cleared this up,
I think actually what I want is the
title of the _tab,_ centered, and
the full logo ‘R’ plus “RunClub”
used only when there’s lots of space,
in the main app just the logo though.
